# FPGA-UART-in-C

## Presentation
This GitHub site gathers all requiered informations to learn how to first handle the DEO-Nano-Soc from the software installation to the reicieve of a UART port. The goals of this project are to discover the board, see how it works, learn how to code it, how to use the different elements available on the board and finally to recieve signals from a UART port. 

## Provided materials
    
* A video tutorial, in which is explained how to connect the board, how to create a new project, how to control a LED with the board and the intel Quartus. As well as a tutorial on how receive and process data from a UART port and the presentation of the results.
* Source codes used during the project. 
     

This project was carried out at the UMONS Faculty of Engineering in April-May 2022 as part of the Hardware-Software Platforms course with Professor C. Valderamma.
